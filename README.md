# ✍️ Handwriting Recognition on MNIST using kNN and CNN

### Author: Puneet Sharma

This project demonstrates a handwriting recognition system built using two machine learning approaches:

1. **k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)** — a simple yet powerful non-parametric classifier  
2. **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** — a deep learning model optimized for image recognition

We evaluate both models on the **MNIST dataset** of handwritten digits and compare their performance in terms of **accuracy, scalability, and computational efficiency**.

## 📦 Project Highlights

- Data loading and preprocessing (normalization, flattening, visualization)
- kNN implementation with hyperparameter tuning (`k` value)
- Distance metric experimentation (Euclidean and Manhattan)
- Dimensionality reduction using **PCA**
- CNN implementation using **TensorFlow/Keras**
- Model evaluation using accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix
- Visualizations of predictions and misclassifications
- Performance comparison between kNN and CNN

## 🧪 Dataset

- **MNIST Handwritten Digit Dataset**
- 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images
- Each image is 28x28 pixels, grayscale
- Label: Digit (0–9)
